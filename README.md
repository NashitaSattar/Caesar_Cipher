# Caesar Cipher
This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest and most well-known encryption techniques. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt a message by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.
